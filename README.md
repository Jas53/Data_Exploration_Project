Based on the feature “*Country or region*”, “*Overall rank*”,” *GDP per capita*”, “*Social support*”, “*Healthy life expectancy*”, “*Freedom to make life choices*”, “*Generosity*” und “*Perceptions of corruption*” the target feature "*Score*" will be predicted.

The model will be evaluated with the metrics *mean squared error*, *mean absolute error* and *mean absolute percentage error*.
